# How are we going to work?
- we have weekly iterations: planning > coding > retrospective
- stories are on the board
- we break down stories to smaller problems - "divide and conquer"
- solve each small problem to our best understanding with focus on solution not implementation
- team code review to discuss the solution and potential improvements
- improvements to make our solution a piece of art and learn new things :)
- we will have 30m block everyday for QA and lightning talks 
- ~10h a week

---

# What are the tools?
- github
- vscode as IDE
- trello for task/documentation management
- slack channel

---

# What do we have to accept?
- We **will not get fluent in any of the technologies**. We have only 30-40h it's not even close to 10000h to master a topic
- We will get **blocked** a milion of times and get frustrated with our code not working. That's totally fine it happens to all developers keep in mind you are not alone - don't be afraid to ask for help
- Working on this project will be disrupted by our Lykon duties we need to learn how to manage our time and do context switch

---

# So what is the goal...
- Solve real world problems with technology
- Know were to look for knowledge, solutions and support
- Build software engineering skills: understanding problem and using existing solutions to solve it
- Get knowledge on building APIs

# Project planning

---

# Let's get started!
https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony3
instead of PHPStorm use vscode: 
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/php

### First task
After following the tutorial, start a new local symfony project and provide an endpoint /hello/{name} which returns /hello/Michał

```
{
	"hello": "Michał"
}
```
